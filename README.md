![hello](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53453731/91340649-f7b5f400-e79d-11ea-9ffb-9fa647607451.png)

* The CVIP Toolbox for MATLAB is a collection of computer vision and image processing functions developed at the Computer Vision and Image Processing Laboratory (CVIP Lab) at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, under the continuing direction of Dr. Scott E Umbaugh. One of the primary purposes of the toolbox is to allow students, educators and researchers a simple, easy to use platform for the exploration of image processing techniques. Users can install the toolbox and use the functions as other built-in functions in the MATLAB environment.The original CVIPtools is a comprehensive GUI-based software which includes image analysis, enhancement, restoration and compression algorithms

* THe current verision is MATLAB 3.5 and the new version will be uploaded soon.
